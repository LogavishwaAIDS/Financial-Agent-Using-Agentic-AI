# Financial-Agent-Using-Agentic-AI
This project is a learning-focused implementation of Agentic AI, where multiple intelligent agents work together to perform finance-related tasks. It leverages the PhiData framework to integrate tools like YFinance and DuckDuckGo, with coordination powered by Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet LLM.
